This project was implemented for the course AI, during the winter semester of 2021, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens. 

The goal of this project is to define an exam scheduling problem as a CSP problem and then use the implemented algorithms in csp.py to analyze the results. 

Also in the csp.py file is implemented the Dom-wdeg heuristic according to this paper: http://www.frontiersinai.com/ecai/ecai2004/ecai04/pdf/p0146.pdf paragraph 3.3.
