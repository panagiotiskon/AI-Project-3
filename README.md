This project was implemented for the class of AI, during the winter semester of 2021. The goal of this project is to define an exam scheduling problem as 
CSP problem and then use the implemented algorithms in csp.py to solve it. Examine these solutions make conclusions about the results and the time 
they take to run. Also implement the Dom-wdeg heuristic in csp.py according to this paper: http://www.frontiersinai.com/ecai/ecai2004/ecai04/pdf/p0146.pdf
